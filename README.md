Website Vulnerability Predictor (Alpha prototype)

Python
TensorFlow
License

A machine learning-based tool for predicting vulnerabilities in websites. It trains a deep neural network on CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data to classify weaknesses (based on CWE names) and analyzes live URLs for potential issues like XSS, SSL problems, and script vulnerabilities. The tool generates detailed reports in CSV and PDF formats.
Features

    Model Training: Uses PySpark for data merging and TensorFlow for training a bidirectional LSTM model with expanded dense layers on CVE datasets.
    Live URL Analysis: Extracts website features (headers, content, technologies), performs specific checks (XSS, SSL, script issues), and predicts vulnerabilities using the trained model.
    Risk Assessment: Classifies risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) based on prediction confidence.
    Recommendations: Generates security recommendations tailored to detected issues.
    Reports: Saves results as CSV (detailed data) and PDF (formatted summary) with progress tracking via tqdm.
    Modular Design: Code is split into separate files for easy maintenance (e.g., checkers, savers).

Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    NVIDIA GPU (optional, for faster training; tested with RTX 3050)
    Datasets: Place CVE CSV files (cve.csv, products.csv, vendor_product.csv, vendors.csv) in a dataset/ folder.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/website-vulnerability-predictor.git
    cd website-vulnerability-predictor

    Install dependencies:

    pip install tensorflow requests beautifulsoup4 tqdm reportlab pandas numpy lxml pyspark

        For GPU support: Ensure CUDA/cuDNN are installed and follow TensorFlow GPU setup.
        If PDF generation fails: pip install reportlab.

    (Optional) Prepare datasets: Download CVE data from sources like NVD and place in dataset/.

Usage
1. Train the Model

    Run the training script:

    python train_model.py

    This loads/merges CVE data, preprocesses it, trains the model, and saves deep_model.keras, tokenizer.json, and label_to_int.txt.
    Adjust sampling fraction or limits in the script if needed for dataset size.

2. Analyze a URL

    Run the predictor:

    python main.py https://example.com

    Options:
        --model <path>: Path to trained model (default: deep_model.keras).
        --tokenizer <path>: Path to tokenizer (default: tokenizer.json).
        --labels <path>: Path to label mappings (default: label_to_int.txt).
        --output-dir <folder>: Report save location (default: ml_analyze_out).
        --verbose: Show detailed logs and features.
        --no-pdf: Skip PDF generation.
        --no-csv: Skip CSV generation.

    Example: python main.py https://google.com --verbose --output-dir test_reports.

    Output: Console report with predictions, recommendations, and saved files in the output directory (e.g., CSV for data, PDF for summary).

✅ Reports generated successfully

Testing

    Test with a secure site: python main.py https://google.com (expect LOW risk).
    Test with a potentially vulnerable site: Use demo sites like http://testphp.vulnweb.com (note: ethical testing only).
    Verify reports: Open generated CSV/PDF files for details.

Troubleshooting

    Model Loading Errors: Ensure trained files exist and paths match.
    Hanging Checks: SSL checker includes timeouts; adjust in ssl_checker.py if needed.
    PDF Overflow: Fixed with word wrapping; update pdf_saver.py if issues persist.
    Memory Issues: Reduce batch size in training or use smaller sampling.
    Logs: Run with --verbose for details.
